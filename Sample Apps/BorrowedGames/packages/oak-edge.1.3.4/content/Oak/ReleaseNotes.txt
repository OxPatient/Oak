=============== CHANGES ==================
- Camibum and company now plays nice with auto properties.
- Added InitializeExtensions method. If you want to leverage mix-ins, 
  this method need to be explicitly called in the constructor of classes
  that use *static* autoproperties. Invocation is automatically done
  if you use dynamic properties.
- The Expando property in Gemini is now named Prototype.
- Case invariant dictionary is used now to store dynamic properties (ie Prototype).
